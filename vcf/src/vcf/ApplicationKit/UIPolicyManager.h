*Document/View architecture. Some of the new features are:
*  automatic creation and connection of the various parts including the
*  Document, view and Window.
*  Automatic default menu items, to ensure standard UI conformance. The menu
*  items are merged with an existing ones.
*  Automatic clipboard support in the form of cut/copy/paste and connecting this
*  directly to the current document
*  Support for Undo/Redo item as well, including default menu item validation
*  Default support for opening and saving documents, including presenting the
*  correct Dialogs to the User, and properly filling the default data, based
*  on the documents data.
*  Support for multiple document types
*  Support for differnt Document Interface policies. Currently we support
*  SDI (Single Document Interface) and MDI (Multiple Document Interface)
*
