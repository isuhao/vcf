*Revision 1.11.4.3  2003/09/12 00:09:32  ddiego

*single inline and stripped them from the various class headers
*
*Revision 1.11.4.2  2003/09/06 19:45:45  ddiego
*changes to ensure that the destroy() is properly called.
*Destructors were moved back to pbulic scope in case that was causing a bug.
*Moving them all(all teh component derived classes) to private scope causes
*a complete failure in hte VC6 compiler. Alas...
*So destructors are present, and modal dialogs can still be created on the
*stack, but almost any other component should be created on the heap, and
*gotten rid of via free() NOT using operator delete directly.
*also moved the vcs info to the end of the file for some of the headers
*This will be an ongoing process.
*
*Revision 1.11.4.1  2003/09/05 21:03:39  ddiego

*distinct classes, one for input and one for output.
*
*Revision 1.10  2003/02/26 04:30:38  ddiego
*merge of code in the devmain-0-5-9 branch into the current tree.

*exclusively from the older event handler macros.
*
