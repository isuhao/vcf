*changes for dir reorganization: _VCF_MACRO_H__
*
*Revision 1.5  2003/12/18 05:15:57  ddiego
*merge from devmain-0-6-2 branch into the stable branch
*
*Revision 1.4.2.2  2003/09/21 04:15:34  ddiego
*moved the cvs info data to teh bottom of the header instead of the

*instead of having to wade through all the cvs info stuff.
*
*Revision 1.4.2.1  2003/09/12 00:09:32  ddiego
*added better tabbing behaviour - fixed an earlier bug.
*Code is easier to understand and it simplified the implementation
*a bit as well
*Moved around the RTTI definitions for various Appkit classes to a
*single inline and stripped them from the various class headers
*
*Revision 1.4  2003/08/09 02:56:43  ddiego
*merge over from the devmain-0-6-1 branch
*Changes
*Features:
*-Added additional implementation to better support the MVC architecture in
*the VCF
*
*-Added a Document/View architecure that is similar to MFC's or NextSteps's
*Doc/View architectures
*
*-Integrated the Anti Grain Graphics library into the GraphicsKit. There is
*now basic support for it in terms of drawing vector shapes
*(fills and strokes). Image support will come in the next release
*
*-Added several documented graphics tutorials
*
*Bugfixes:
*
*[ 775744 ] wrong buttons on a dialog
*[ 585239 ] Painting weirdness in a modal dialog ?

*Plus an issue with some focus and getting the right popup window to activate
*has also been fixed

*Revision 1.3.2.1  2003/06/28 04:43:20  ddiego
*cleaned up the vcf/include/events directory and got rid of files, moving
*some of the various event handler template classes into the same header
*that the event handler's event is associated with
*also made some changes to properly take advantage of a Control's View, if it
*is set.
*
*Revision 1.3  2003/05/17 20:37:07  ddiego
*this is the checkin for the 0.6.1 release - represents the merge over from
*the devmain-0-6-0 branch plus a few minor bug fixes
*
*Revision 1.2.22.2  2003/03/13 05:07:25  ddiego
*added some more documentation, and implemented the clone() method in all of the
*core event classes for the FoundationKit, GraphicsKit, and ApplicationKit.
*
*Revision 1.2.22.1  2003/03/12 03:09:50  ddiego
*switched all member variable that used the "m_"<name> prefix to
* <name>"_" suffix nameing standard.
*Also changed all vcf builder files to accomadate this.
*Changes were made to the Stream classes to NOT multiple inheritance and to
*be a little more correct. Changes include breaking the FileStream into two
*distinct classes, one for input and one for output.
*
*Revision 1.2  2002/01/24 01:46:47  ddiego
*added a cvs "log" comment to the top of all files in vcf/src and vcf/include
